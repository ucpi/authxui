      </h1>
      <p>
        AuthX is very important because UX is the biggest barrier in user growth
        across Web3 applications. Masses are not comfortable with wallets, Seed
        phrase, private key and all such stuff. They need easier ways to
        interact with web3, ideally what they have been using in web2.
      </p>
      <p>
        AuthX enables web3 apps to leverage the simplicity and distribution of
        web2 user id's to onboard new users and offer them a smooth UX.
      </p>
